These are the Python libraries and external services explicitly used in the code.

Python Libraries:

streamlit: For the web-based UI.
numpy: For numerical operations (e.g., image processing, audio generation).
opencv-python (cv2): For image processing and face detection preprocessing.
tensorflow==2.12.0: For loading and running the Mini-Xception model.
transformers: For sentiment analysis with DistilBERT.
audiocraft: For music generation with MusicGen.
soundfile: For saving generated audio files.
google-generativeai: For text mood analysis and chatbot via Gemini API.
google-api-python-client: For YouTube API integration.
pandas: For data manipulation (e.g., mood history).
scikit-learn: For MinMaxScaler in biometric analysis.
pillow (PIL): For image handling.
torch: Required by Audiocraft/MusicGen.
scipy: For fallback audio generation.
matplotlib: For mood trend visualization.
spotipy: For Spotify API integration.
mediapipe: For face detection in images.
requests: For API calls (e.g., smartwatch, IP geolocation).
backoff: For retrying failed API requests.

External Models:

fer2013_mini_XCEPTION.102-0.66.hdf5: Pre-trained Mini-Xception model for emotion detection (must be downloaded separately).

distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english: Pre-trained sentiment analysis model (downloaded by Transformers).
facebook/musicgen-small: Pre-trained MusicGen model (downloaded by Audiocraft).

External APIs/Services:
Gemini API: For text mood analysis and chatbot (GOOGLE_API_KEY).
YouTube API: For song recommendations (YOUTUBE_API_KEY).
Spotify API: For track recommendations (SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID, SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET).
IP Geolocation: Uses ipapi.co (no key required).
Smartwatch API: Mocked, but real integration would require an API key (e.g., Fitbit API).
