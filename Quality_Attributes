Performance:
Process facial images within 2-5 seconds.
Generate music clips within 10-15 seconds.
Fetch API recommendations within 5 seconds (with retry mechanism for failures).

Scalability:
Support single-user local execution (scalable to cloud with Google Cloud Platform integration).

Reliability:
Handle API failures gracefully with fallbacks (e.g., static song lists, simple tones).
Recover from model loading errors with a fallback CNN model.

Usability:
Provide an intuitive, visually appealing UI with animations and particle effects.
Ensure clear feedback (e.g., spinners, success/error messages).

Security:
Process all sensitive data (images, biometrics, text) locally.
Avoid storing user data beyond session state.
Secure API keys via environment variables (not hardcoded).

Maintainability:
Modular code structure (though currently a single file).
Clear documentation in README.md.

Portability:
Run on Windows, macOS, and Linux with Python 3.8+.

Compatibility:
Support modern web browsers for Streamlit UI.
Work with standard webcam hardware.
